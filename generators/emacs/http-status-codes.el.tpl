;; Explain the meaning of a HTTP status code. Copy httpcode.el to your
;; load-path and add to your .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'http-status-codes)
;;
;; Then run it with M-x http-status-code
;;
;;; Code goes here:

(defconst http-status
  '({{ HTTP_STATUS }}))

;;;###autoload
(defun http-status-code (status)
  "Display the meaning of an HTTP status code or phrase"
  (interactive
   (list (completing-read "Enter HTTP status code or phrase: " http-status)))
  (let* ((uppercased-status (upcase status))
        (found (assoc uppercased-status http-status)))
    (if found
        (let* ((status-code (car found))
               (status-code-attrib (cdr found))
               (phrase (car (car status-code-attrib)))
               (description (car (cdr (car status-code-attrib)))))
