# KNOW YOUR HTTP relations WELL

> HTTP relies upon the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) standard [RFC3986] to indicate the target resource and relationships between resources.

Continue reading on [httpbisp1#2.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging#section-2.1).

> A means of indicating the relationships between resources on the Web, as well as indicating the type of those relationships, has been available for some time in HTML, and more recently in Atom.

Continue reading on [RFC5988#1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-1).

> In this specification, a link is a typed connection between two resources that are identified by Internationalised Resource Identifiers (IRIs), and is comprised of: A context IRI, a link relation type, a target IRI, and optionally, target attributes.

> A link can be viewed as a statement of the form "{context IRI} has a {relation type} resource at {target IRI}, which has {target attributes}".

Continue reading on [RFC5988#3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-3).

> In the simplest case, a link relation type identifies the semantics of a link.
